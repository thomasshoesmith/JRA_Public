Undergraduate Research for the Junior Research Associate Scheme at the University of Sussex

## JRA abstract

Modern Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) still require a lot of processing power. For instance, AlphaGo used approximately 1MW of power to run, whilst a human brain only uses 20W.

Unlike units in ANNs which continuously exchange real-valued activations, neurons in spiking neural networks communicate infrequently using binary events called spikes like neurons in biological 
brains. This reduced communication means that, theoretically, SNNs could offer a much more energy efficient alternative to ANNs. 

Training SNNs from scratch remains tricky but there are several promising approaches for converting 
already trained ANNs to SNNs. The current limitation with SNNs is that they require a lot of signal spikes in order to achieve the same task performance as ANNs; the aim for this project will be to 
investigate more efficient means of spike based encoding of activations in SNNs in order to improve on both, the number of signals required as well as the accuracy of the SNN in image classification.

## What is the JRA?

"The eight-week programme is offered to all of our high performing undergraduate students over the summer. If you're accepted on to the scheme, you get a bursary to work on your research full time, work closely with supervisors, and network with other researchers.

You'll also attend training workshops and have access to University resources.

At the end of the scheme, you'll put together a research poster which is displayed at our Undergraduate Research Poster Exhibition. The top two posters are chosen to represent Sussex at the British Conference of Undergraduate Research (BCUR) annual Posters in Parliament exhibition. 

Since 2008, more than 450 students have participated in the programme - including students from Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS) and there are special provisions for Sussex Neuroscience students."
